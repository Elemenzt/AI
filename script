"Hello there!
Welcome to Prompt Engineering.
Before we dive into our video today, I want to introduce myself.
I'm not a real human - in fact, I'm an AI avatar.
My image was created using MidJourney, which is a really cool tool that allows for highly detailed and realistic 3D modeling.
And, of course, my script was written using Chat GPT, which is an incredibly powerful language model developed by OpenAI.

But that's not all - my voice comes from ElevenLabls, which uses cutting-edge text-to-speech technology to create a seamless and natural-sounding voice for me.
And the video you're watching was put together using D-ID, which is a fantastic platform for creating lifelike video content.

Now, you might be wondering why we're using all of these different tools to create this video.
Well, the answer is simple - we want to showcase the incredible power of AI and its potential to transform the way we work, play, and communicate.
And I'm here to demonstrate just how far we've come in the world of AI and avatar technology.

So, without further ado, let's jump into our video and explore some of the amazing ways that AI is changing our world.
Thanks for tuning in!"
